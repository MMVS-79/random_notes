Will Emacs Be Slow on a MacBook Pro M1?
---------------------------------------
No, Emacs should run very smoothly on a MacBook Pro with an M1 chip. The M1 processor is extremely powerful and well-optimized for software development tasks, including running lightweight text editors like Emacs. Here's why it will perform well:

1. **Performance of M1 Chip**: The M1 chip has excellent single-core performance, which is beneficial for applications like Emacs that primarily use a single thread.

2. **Universal Build**: Recent versions of Emacs (like Emacs 28 and above) are available as native builds for Apple Silicon (arm64). These versions take full advantage of the M1 architecture for maximum performance.

3. **Low Resource Requirements**: Emacs is lightweight and doesn’t require significant system resources, so it will not strain your MacBook Pro, even with plugins or extensions.

4. **Compatibility**: If you're using an older Emacs build designed for Intel Macs, Rosetta 2 ensures seamless compatibility. However, using a native M1 version will provide even better performance.

       Recommendations
       - Use the native Emacs build for Apple Silicon. You can install it via Homebrew with:
```bash
  brew install --cask emacs
  ```
- Alternatively, download the latest prebuilt version of Emacs for macOS M1 from https://emacsformacosx.com.

How to Completely Uninstall Emacs
---------------------------------
To completely uninstall Emacs on macOS, follow these steps:

1. **If You Installed Emacs via Homebrew**
   - Uninstall Emacs:
     ```bash
     brew uninstall --cask emacs
     ```
   - Remove Residual Configuration Files:
     ```bash
     rm -rf ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs ~/.config/emacs
     ```

2. **If You Downloaded Emacs as a Standalone App**
   - Delete the Application:
     - Go to your `Applications` folder.
     - Find the Emacs app, then right-click and select **Move to Trash** (or drag it to the Trash).
   - Remove Configuration Files:
     ```bash
     rm -rf ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs ~/.config/emacs
     ```

3. **If You Built Emacs from Source**
   - Remove the Binary:
     ```bash
     sudo make uninstall
     ```
   - Remove Configuration Files:
     ```bash
     rm -rf ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs ~/.config/emacs
     ```
   - Delete Build Files:
     ```bash
     rm -rf ~/src/emacs
     ```

4. **Remove Related Cache and Preferences**
   Check for leftover files in:
   - **Cache**: `~/Library/Caches`
   - **Preferences**: `~/Library/Preferences`
   - **Application Support**: `~/Library/Application Support`
   - Delete them, e.g.:
     ```bash
     rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.gnu.Emacs
     rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/org.gnu.Emacs.plist
     rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Emacs
     ```

Will `brew install --cask emacs` Add an Application?
----------------------------------------------------
Yes, running `brew install --cask emacs` will install Emacs as a macOS application. Here's what happens:

1. **Application Installation**: 
   - It installs Emacs as a `.app` file in your `/Applications` folder (or the equivalent Homebrew Cask apps directory).
   - You can launch Emacs like any other macOS app by clicking on it in the Finder or Spotlight.

2. **Command-Line Access**: 
   - Homebrew adds Emacs to your system’s PATH, so you can also run it from the terminal by typing `emacs`.
   - This command opens the Emacs app in its graphical user interface (GUI) mode.

3. **Optional Terminal Version**:
   - If you want a terminal-only version of Emacs (running directly in the terminal without a GUI), you can install it with:
     ```bash
     brew install emacs
     ```
   - This version will not create a macOS app but lets you run Emacs in the terminal by typing `emacs`.
