# 🎭 Double Bind in the Workplace: Low Pay, High Expectations

The **Double Bind** (“Damned if you do, damned if you don’t”) is one of the **Seven Master Suppression Techniques**, used to control or undermine someone by placing them in a **no-win situation**.

## 💼 Real-World Workplace Scenario

An employee is:
- Given **increasing responsibilities** (project management, client handling, training others).
- Told their **qualifications don’t warrant a raise** (e.g., “a degree isn’t enough”).
- Yet, these same qualifications **justify giving them more work**.

### ❗ Contradiction (Double Bind)

> **"You’re not skilled enough to earn more"**  
> — yet —  
> **"You’re skilled enough to take on more work."**

You’re trapped:
- Ask for more pay → seen as ungrateful or difficult.
- Stay quiet → remain overworked and underpaid.

## 🧱 Common Suppression Tactics Employers Use

| Tactic | How It Works |
|--------|---------------|
| **Credential Minimization** | “Just having a degree doesn’t mean much anymore.” |
| **Inflated Expectations** | “We’re a startup, everyone goes above and beyond.” |
| **Gaslighting Your Value** | “You should be grateful to have this job.” |
| **Shifting the Goalposts** | “Let’s revisit your raise after the next big project.” (then repeat) |

## 🎯 Why It’s a Double Bind

You’re **expected to perform at a high level** but told you **haven’t earned compensation** to match.

> No matter your choice, you lose — that’s the essence of the Double Bind.

It maintains the **power imbalance** by:
- Undermining your confidence
- Devaluing your contributions
- Delaying fair treatment indefinitely

## 🔄 How to Push Back

- **Document your work**: Track every “extra” duty beyond your job description.
- **Benchmark your role**: Use tools like Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, or PayScale to show salary ranges.
- **Expose the contradiction**:
  > “If I’m trusted with these responsibilities, doesn’t that show I’ve earned more compensation?”
- **Request clarity**: Ask what specific criteria must be met for a raise — get it in writing.
- **Get support**: Find allies or involve HR if possible and safe.
