* Will Emacs Be Slow on a MacBook Pro M1?

No, Emacs should run very smoothly on a MacBook Pro with an M1 chip. The M1 processor is extremely powerful and well-optimized for software development tasks, including running lightweight text editors like Emacs. Here's why it will perform well:

** 1. Performance of M1 Chip
- The M1 chip has excellent single-core performance, which is beneficial for applications like Emacs that primarily use a single thread.

** 2. Universal Build
- Recent versions of Emacs (like Emacs 28 and above) are available as native builds for Apple Silicon (arm64). These versions take full advantage of the M1 architecture for maximum performance.

** 3. Low Resource Requirements
- Emacs is lightweight and doesn’t require significant system resources, so it will not strain your MacBook Pro, even with plugins or extensions.

** 4. Compatibility
- If you're using an older Emacs build designed for Intel Macs, Rosetta 2 ensures seamless compatibility. However, using a native M1 version will provide even better performance.

** Recommendations
- Use the native Emacs build for Apple Silicon. You can install it via Homebrew with:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  brew install --cask emacs
  #+END_SRC
- Alternatively, download the latest prebuilt version of Emacs for macOS M1 from https://emacsformacosx.com.

* How to Completely Uninstall Emacs

To completely uninstall Emacs on macOS, follow these steps:

** 1. If You Installed Emacs via Homebrew
- Uninstall Emacs:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  brew uninstall --cask emacs
  #+END_SRC
- Remove Residual Configuration Files:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rm -rf ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs ~/.config/emacs
  #+END_SRC

** 2. If You Downloaded Emacs as a Standalone App
- Delete the Application:
  - Go to your `Applications` folder.
  - Find the Emacs app, then right-click and select **Move to Trash** (or drag it to the Trash).
- Remove Configuration Files:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rm -rf ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs ~/.config/emacs
  #+END_SRC

** 3. If You Built Emacs from Source
- Remove the Binary:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo make uninstall
  #+END_SRC
- Remove Configuration Files:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rm -rf ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs ~/.config/emacs
  #+END_SRC
- Delete Build Files:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rm -rf ~/src/emacs
  #+END_SRC

** 4. Remove Related Cache and Preferences
Check for leftover files in:
- **Cache**: `~/Library/Caches`
- **Preferences**: `~/Library/Preferences`
- **Application Support**: `~/Library/Application Support`
- Delete them, e.g.:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.gnu.Emacs
  rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/org.gnu.Emacs.plist
  rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Emacs
  #+END_SRC

* Will `brew install --cask emacs` Add an Application?

Yes, running `brew install --cask emacs` will install Emacs as a macOS application. Here's what happens:

** 1. Application Installation
- It installs Emacs as a `.app` file in your `/Applications` folder (or the equivalent Homebrew Cask apps directory).
- You can launch Emacs like any other macOS app by clicking on it in the Finder or Spotlight.

** 2. Command-Line Access
- Homebrew adds Emacs to your system’s PATH, so you can also run it from the terminal by typing `emacs`.
- This command opens the Emacs app in its graphical user interface (GUI) mode.

** 3. Optional Terminal Version
- If you want a terminal-only version of Emacs (running directly in the terminal without a GUI), you can install it with:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  brew install emacs
  #+END_SRC
- This version will not create a macOS app but lets you run Emacs in the terminal by typing `emacs`.

* Using `emacs -nw` (No Window Mode)

If you prefer to run Emacs in the terminal without the graphical user interface (GUI), you can use the `-nw` (no-window) flag when starting Emacs. Here's how it works:

** 1. Running Emacs in Terminal Mode
- When you run `emacs -nw`, Emacs will start inside your terminal window rather than launching as a graphical application.
- This can be especially useful if you're working over SSH or on a machine without a GUI, or if you simply prefer the terminal environment.

  Example:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  emacs -nw
  #+END_SRC

** 2. Benefits of Using `-nw`
- **Faster Startup**: Running Emacs in terminal mode can result in faster startup times because it doesn't have to initialize the graphical interface.
- **Lower Resource Usage**: Without the GUI, Emacs consumes fewer system resources, making it a good option for lower-powered systems or when working remotely.
- **Keyboard-Centric Interface**: The terminal mode is designed to be keyboard-driven, which is ideal for users who are accustomed to navigating via keyboard shortcuts and commands.

** 3. Switching Between GUI and Terminal Mode
- If you start Emacs with `emacs` (without the `-nw` flag), it will launch in GUI mode.
- To switch between the terminal version and the GUI version, you can simply run `emacs -nw` for terminal mode, or `emacs` for the graphical version.
